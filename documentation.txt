---------------------------------- Delightful Downloads Documentation ----------------------------
Da das Open Source Delightful Download Plugin für Wordpress zwar im Quellcode noch auf Github zu finden ist, aber dort keine #Dokumentation liegt, habe ich die mir heruntergeladene Doku mal aufbereitet und stelle sie hier zur Verfuegung. Die Doku ist in englischer Sprache und erklärt Shortcodes und Attribute.  Ich habe die Moeglichkeit und Wildcard, eine Beschreibung zum Download einzugeben, ergaenzt, sowie einige Ausgabeformate (box, link) und die Listenausgabe angepasst.

------------------------------------  FAQ -------------------------
General
Can I manually upload files via FTP/SFTP?
Yes, simply upload them to your server anywhere within the WordPress file structure (usually wp-content/uploads/). Once uploaded, you can enter the file URL into the Add New Download screen.

How do I increase the maximum file upload size?
Please refer to this tutorial on how to increase the maximum file size in WordPress.

How do I add additional allowed file types to the file uploader?
Please refer to this tutorial on how to add additional file types to WordPress.

Usage
How do I output a single download link?
Use the shortcode [[ddownload id="123"]]. Replace the ID with the desired download ID, which can be found in the All Downloads screen.

How do I output a single download file size?
Use the shortcode [[ddownload_size id="123"]]. Replace the ID with the desired download ID, which can be found in the All Downloads screen.

How do I output the number of times a single file has been downloaded?
Use the shortcode [[ddownload_count id="123"]]. Replace the ID with the desired download ID, which can be found in the All Downloads screen.

How do I output a list of download links?
Use the shortcode [[ddownload_list]].

How do I output the number of times all of my files have been download?
Use the shortcode [[ddownload_total_count]].

Troubleshooting
Why when I click a download link does the download count not update?
This is usually caused by being logged in as an admin. Downloads by admin users are not automatically logged, however you can change this behaviour in the Settings screen under the Statistics tab.

If using the [[ddownload_total_count]] shortcode, the count is also cached by default and will only update every few minutes based on the Cache Duration, which is set in the Settings screen under the Advanced tab.

Why do I receive a 403 Forbidden error when I try to access a file directly?
Delightful Downloads automatically blocks direct access to files stored within the wp-content/uploads/delightful-downloads/ directory. To access the file you must use the [[ddownload id="123"]] shortcode.

Why do my files download with the incorrect file extension?
This is caused when WordPress does not know the file type your are serving to users. Please refer to this tutorial on how to add additional file types to WordPress.

Why do my remote files open directly in the browser?
When serving remote files it is not possible to set the correct headers which force a file to be downloaded, instead the browser will attempt to open them.

Why do my files show a file size of unknown?
This is caused when the file does not exist at the location specified or is inaccessible due to incorrect permissions.
